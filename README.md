# conn
 Conn (showconn.sh , you can alias it as conn ) is a shell script that counts estabilished connections (Total / TCP / UDP / SSH (port 22) / HTTPS (port 443) / HTTP (port 80) / Other), showing the number of current connections in real time, and min / max / average connections since the script started. Optionally it also shows current total / used / free / available memory.
